# Reaper_Copy-track-color-sws-hex-format

Script for use within Reaper(DAW).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copies selected track color to clipboard, formatted for use in SWS Auto Color.
Format is hex(RRGGBB) with "0x" signing. ex. "0xRRGGBB"
Has only been tested on windows. It's possible that different OS may have RBG in a different order, but I think this is no longer an issue.

Install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy script to Reaper scripts folder.
